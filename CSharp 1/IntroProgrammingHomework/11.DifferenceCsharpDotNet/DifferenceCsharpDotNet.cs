/*C# is a modern object-oriented, general-purpose programming language, created and developed by Microsoft together with the .NET platform. There is highly diverse software developed with C# and on the .NET platform: office applications, web applications, websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, games and many others.
The C# language is not distributed as a standalone product – it is a part of the Microsoft .NET Framework platform. The .NET Framework generally consists of an environment for the development and execution of programs, written in C# or some other language, compatible with.
All in all, the difference comes from the fact that the C# language is part of the .NET Framework and the language cannot be used without the other components of the platform (CLR, CSharp compiler and many other components).
