/*Some of the most popular high-level languages are C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL. 
C# is a high-level language that is similar to Java and C++ and, to some extent, languages like Delphi, VB.NET and C.
 Java is the most serious competitor to C#. Unlike C# and the .NET Framework, the Java language and platform are open-source projects that an entire community of software companies, organizations and individual developers take part in. The standards, the specifications and all the new features in the world of Java are developed by workgroups formed out of the entire Java community, rather than a single company (as the case of C# and .NET Framework)
Another widely used language is PHP. In the software industry, PHP is used mostly for small projects (small web sites and web applications), because it can easily lead developers into writing code that is bad, disorganized and hard to maintain, making it inconvenient for more substantial projects. PHP is a procedural language in concept and although it supports the paradigms of modern object-oriented programming, most PHP programmers write procedurally.
C and C++ languages are considered rather primitive, old and decaying. They still have their uses and are suitable for low-level programming. Programming in pure C is suitable to write an operating system, a hardware device driver or if you want to program an embedded device, because of the lack of alternatives and the need to control the hardware very carefully. C++ is acceptable when you have to program applications that require very close work with the hardware or have special performance requirements
